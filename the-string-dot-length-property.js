// the-string-dot-length-property.js
/*

Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

// Starter Code (Pre-filled):
// Predefined strings
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";
let stringTwo = "JavaScript";
let stringThree = "";

let lengthOne = stringOne.length;   // Use the .length property to calculate the Length of stringOne
let lengthTwo = stringTwo.length;   // Use the .length property to calculate the Length of stringTwo
let lengthThree = stringThree.length;  // Use the .length property to calculate the Length of stringThree

console.log("What is the length of stringOne:", lengthOne); // print the length of the first string to varify calculation
console.log("What is the length of stringOne:", lengthTwo); // print the length of the second string to varify calculation
console.log("What is the length of stringOne:", lengthThree); // print the length of the third string to varify calculation
